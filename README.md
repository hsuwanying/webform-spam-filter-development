# Webform Spam Filter Development
### Developing a spam filter for detecting web form spam applied with feature selection techniques and classification models

Master Thesis is submitted as part of the module for MSc in Applied Information and Data Science at School of Business, Lucerne University of Applied Science and Art.

## Summary
This research discusses theoretical aspects of spam filtering, web structure, and internet communication. Comparing web forms and email data structure lays the fundament for creating a spam filer architecture. Popular machine learning techniques with classification functions, namely non-linear statistical models and tree-based learning techniques, are reviewed; and three machine learning methods: **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**, are chosen for fitting models. **Confusion matrix** and **cross-validation** are deplyed to estimate the test errors of proposed models. The result shows, the Random Forest model has outperformed in classifying spam class and has **achieved 99% accuracy with the least test error rate 0.1%**. Insights generated through this research have provided recommendations for the future adjustment to the FormCheck spam filter.
