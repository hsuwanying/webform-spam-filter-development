# Project Summary
This research discusses theoretical aspects of spam filtering, web structure, and internet communication. Comparing web forms and email data structure lays the fundament for creating a spam filter architecture. Popular machine learning techniques with classification functions, namely non-linear statistical models and tree-based learning techniques, are reviewed; and three machine learning methods: **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**, are chosen for fitting models. **Confusion matrix** and **cross-validation** are deployed to estimate the test errors of proposed models. The result shows the Random Forest model has outperformed in classifying spam classes and has **achieved 99% accuracy with the least test error rate of 0.1%**. Insights generated through this research have provided recommendations for future adjustments to the FormCheck spam filter.
